# DropPing

Drop{ing is a location-based notification pushing mobile application designed for Android devices. It automatically detects when a user reaches important locations, such as a college or railway station, and sends SMS notifications to selected contacts. This project is a college assignment for testing with a small group of friends, with no plans for commercialization or app store deployment (as of yet).

- **SMS Notifications:** Sends pre-configured SMS messages to chosen contacts.
- **Custom Locations:** Allows users to set and manage important locations.
- **Contact Management:** Select specific contacts to receive notifications.
- **Background Operation:** Runs efficiently in the background without significant battery consumption.
